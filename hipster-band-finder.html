# Hipster Band Finder

In this experiment, we'll attempt to replicate a classic hipster pastime: to
find one really great band that no one has ever heard of.

To do this, we'll use at a [publicly available
dataset](http://jmcauley.ucsd.edu/data/amazon/) of 63k reviews of music posted
to Amazon.com spanning May 1996 - July 2014.

There are a few inherent limitations in this data set:

1) It doesn't distinguish between CD, vinyl and digital sales, which would
definitely help filter for hipster cred.

2) It includes data from a mainstream retailer, so probably doesn't include the
very best bands, which we all know are sold on recycled 8 track tapes out of a
leather suitcase at the Fort Greene flea market in Brooklyn on the first
Saturday of the month.

That said, given those limitations, we should still have some fun and illustrate
using Python, Numpy and Pandas inside Iodide along the way.  This assumes some
basic familiarity with Pandas.

%% md

## Loading Python

The first thing we want to do is load the Pyodide plugin for Iodide, which will
give us Python support. (Don't worry too much about the details here. This
is just a snippet of JSON that describes how to load and use the language
plugin.)

%% plugin
{
  "languageId": "py",
  "displayName": "python",
  "codeMirrorMode": "python",
  "keybinding": "p",
  "url": "https://iodide.io/pyodide-demo/pyodide.js",
  "module": "pyodide",
  "evaluator": "runPython",
  "pluginType": "language"
}

%% md

We now have a Python environment loaded and ready to go.  Let's test it.

%% code {"language":"py"}

import sys
sys.version

%% md

## Loading Pandas

Pyodide doesn't automatically load all of the third party packages, so we first
need to load Pandas into the browsers virtual file system:

%% js
pyodide.loadPackage("pandas")

%% md
## Load the data into a data frame

Pyodide contains a few helper functions for working in a browser environment in
the `pyodide` module.

In this case, we'll use `pyodide.open_url` to fetch the data from a URL and
convert it into a Python file-like object that Pandas understands how to read.
Under the hood it's using the Javascript `XMLHttpRequest` object to do the
network transfer, but it all looks like synchronous file reading to Python.

%% code {"language":"py"}

import pandas as pd
import pyodide

df = pd.read_csv(pyodide.open_url("./music-reviews.csv"))
df.describe(include='all')

%% md

## The columns

Each row in the table represents an album.

The columns are:

- `amazon-id`: A unique ID Amazon uses for every product. You can plug this into
  the URL `http://amazon.com/gp/product/{amazon-id}` to see what it corresponds
  to.
- `artist`: The artist name
- `n-reviews`: The number of reviews submitted
- `overall`: The average review score (from 1 to 5, but 0 if there are no
  reviews)
- `price`: The price (in USD)
- `root-genre`: The primary genre of the album, from a set of only 16 values
- `salesRank`: Where the item ranks with respect to other items on Amazon. The
  data set does not include actual sales numbers, only ranking.
- `title`: The album name

%% md

## Data cleanup

Let's start by doing some data cleanup.

%% md

Looking at the column summary for the number of reviews, you can see that
there's quite a large number of albums without any reviews. We can't really make
any conclusions about albums without reviews, and it's probably spurious to make
conclusions about albums with less than, say, 3 reviews, so let's remove those
from the data set.

%% code {"language":"py"}

df = df[df['n-reviews'] >= 3.0]
len(df)

%% md

The `salesRank` column is a ranking across all products at Amazon, including
toasters and cat toys. For simplicity, let's make the rankings contiguous only
within the Music products. That's easy with the `rank` method:

%% code {"language":"py"}

df['salesRank'] = df['salesRank'].rank()

%% md

Now it would be helpful to plot some things in order to look more at the nature
of the data.

Pandas has very convenient and tight integration with matplotlib, but
unfortunately we don't have matplotlib running in the browser. Instead, we can
pass the data from Pandas to any Javascript plotting library. In this case,
we'll use [Plotly](http://plot.ly).

(Note that even though Plotly has a Python interface, we're not using that here.
It's not really needed since with Pyodide, we can just pass Python objects to
any Javascript library with ease.)

The first thing we need to do is import the code for Plotly using a resource
cell:

%% resource

https://cdn.plot.ly/plotly-latest.min.js

%% md

Let's look at the distribution of the number of reviews per album. Note we using
a log scale here.

%% code {"language":"py"}

from js import Plotly
from js import iodide

Plotly.plot(
    iodide.output.element('div'), # This t
    [{ 'y': sorted(df['n-reviews'], reverse=True) }],
    {
      'yaxis': {'type': 'log'},
      'width': 800
    })

%% md

While a handful of albums have almost 2,000 reviews, the vast majority have less
than 10.

Out of curiosity, let's see what the most reviewed album is:

%% code {"language":"py"}

df.loc[df['n-reviews'].argmax()]

%% md

Now let's get back to finding our hipster band. Let's make sure there will be
enough well-reviewed albums that have a low sales rank.

Let's make a scatter plot of all albums showing `review` vs. `salesRank`.

%% code {"language":"py"}

Plotly.plot(
  iodide.output.element('div'),
  [{
    'x': list(df['salesRank']),
    'y': list(df['overall']),
    'text': list(df['title']),
    'type': 'scattergl',
    'mode': 'markers',
    'opacity': 0.5,
    'marker': {'size': 2.0}
  }],
  { 'width': 800 })

%% md

You can see that while there are good albums all across the entire `salesRank`
range, better reviews do seem to correspond to more sales, but only just barely.
Let's fit a line to these points using `numpy.polyfit` to show that:

%% code {"language":"py"}

import numpy as np
m, b = np.polyfit(df['salesRank'], df['overall'], deg=1)
x = np.arange(df['salesRank'].max())

%% code {"language":"py"}

Plotly.plot(
  iodide.output.element('div'),
  [{
    'x': list(df['salesRank']),
    'y': list(df['overall']),
    'text': list(df['title']),
    'type': 'scattergl',
    'mode': 'markers',
    'opacity': 0.5,
    'marker': {'size': 2.0}
  },
  {
    'x': x,
    'y': m*x + b,
    'type': 'scattergl',
    'mode': 'line'
  }],
  { 'width': 800 })

%% md

This is all quite rough because we are working with sales "rankings" and not
actual sales figures in terms of items sold or dollars, so we can't draw too
many conclusions.

Since we are actually looking for the most hipster *band* and not *album*, let's
regroup our data by artist.

%% code {"language":"py"}

artists = df.groupby('artist').agg(
    {'n-reviews': 'sum',
     'overall': 'mean',
     'price': 'mean',
     'salesRank': 'mean',
     'title': 'count'})
artists.describe(include='all')

%% md

Let's define "the most hipster band" as the band with all 5-star reviews with
the lowest sales ranking.

%% code {"language":"py"}

five_stars = artists[artists['overall'] == 5.0]
hipster = artists.loc[five_stars['salesRank'].argmax()]
hipster

%% md

That's great! We have a name. Let's make a little convenience function to make
it easier to show their albums on Amazon.

%% code {"language":"py"}

from js import document

def show_albums(name):
    albums = df[df['artist'] == name]
    ul = iodide.output.element('ul')
    for idx, album in albums.iterrows():
        li = document.createElement('li')
        a = document.createElement('a')
        a.setAttribute('href', 'http://amazon.com/gp/product/' + album['amazon-id'])
        a.setAttribute('target', '_blank')
        a.textContent = album['title']
        li.appendChild(a)
        ul.appendChild(li)

%% code {"language":"py"}

show_albums(hipster.name)

%% md

This seems like a good choice, but this artist only seems to have put out one
album. What if we want a band that has been toiling in obscurity over many
years, putting out album after poor-selling album? Let's filter the dataset to
only include bands with at least 3 albums.

%% code {"language":"py"}

hipster = artists.loc[five_stars[five_stars['title'] >= 3.0]['salesRank'].argmax()]
hipster

%% code {"language":"py"}

show_albums(hipster.name)
